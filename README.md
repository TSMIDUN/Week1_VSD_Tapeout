# Week1_VSD_Tapeout


## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand **RTL coding styles** and testbench basics  
- Run **simulation** using Icarus Verilog + GTKWave  
- Perform **logic synthesis** with Yosys  
- Explore the role of **timing libraries (.lib)** in mapping RTL to gates  
- Generate **netlists** and prepare designs for later flow stages

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day is organized into its own folder:

- [Day 1 – Introduction to Verilog RTL design and Synthesis](Day1/README.md)  
- [Day 2 – .lib Files, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis and Flop coding styles](Day2/README.md)  
- [Day 3 – Optimization in Combinational & Sequential Logic](Day_3/README.md)  
- [Day 4 – Gate-Level Simulation & Coding Styles](Day_4/README.md)  
- [Day 5 – Constraint-Driven Synthesis & Final Wrap-Up](Day_5/README.md)  

Each **day folder** contains:
- `README.md` → Concepts + lab steps  
- `images/` → Diagrams, screenshots  
- `src/` → Verilog codes, scripts
