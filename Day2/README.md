## Openning Multiple Module

### Hierarchical vs. Flat Synthesis

This comparison shows how Yosys handles a design containing multiple modules.

### üü¢ 2.1. Hierarchical Synthesis (Preserving Structure)

**Definition:** Maps logic to gates while **retaining the boundaries** of your original Verilog modules.

| Aspect | Feature | Yosys Command Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | **Blocks kept separate** (Multiple modules). | **`synth -top [module]`** (The `flatten` command is OMITTED). |
| **Advantage** | **Easy Debugging** üîç and **IP Reuse**. | |
| **Trade-off** | Optimizations are limited to inside module boundaries. | |

### üü¢ 2.2. Flat Synthesis (Collapsing Structure)

**Definition:** **Merges** all logic from submodules into a single top module, eliminating the original structure.

| Aspect | Feature | Yosys Command Key |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | **One big circuit** (Hierarchy eliminated). | **`synth -top [module]`** followed by **`flatten`**. |
| **Advantage** | **Maximum Optimization** ‚ú® for speed/area. | |
| **Trade-off** | **Harder to Debug** because the original Verilog structure is lost. | |

The key to these special case optimizations is that multiplication by a constant can be converted into simpler, more efficient bit-shift and addition operations.

1. Multiplication by Powers of 2 (Bit-Shift)
The expression assign y = a * 2; results in zero additional gates because multiplying any binary number by a power of two is equivalent to a Left Bit-Shift operation.

Optimization: The synthesis tool realizes y=a√ó2=a‚â™1.

Hardware: A bit-shift is implemented simply by wiring the input bits to the output at shifted positions. It requires no logic gates; the tool only uses concatenation to implement the shift.

Optimized Verilog Construct: assign y = { a, 1'b0 }; (The input a is concatenated with a constant '0' at the LSB).


**Asynchronous Set Flop (`dff_async_set`)**

```verilog
module dff_async_set ( input clk ,  input async_set , input d , output reg q );
always @ (posedge clk , posedge async_set)
begin
	if(async_set)
		q <= 1'b1;
	else	
		q <= d;
end
endmodule
```

2. Decomposition for Constant Multiplication
For a non-power-of-two constant like 9, the synthesis tool decomposes the multiplication into a combination of bit-shifts and additions, which is much cheaper than a full multiplier.

Decomposition: The tool rewrites the multiplication based on powers of two:

y=a√ó9=a√ó(8+1)=(a√ó8)+(a√ó1)
Simplified Logic: Using bit-shifts, this becomes:

y=(a‚â™3)+a
Resulting Hardware: The final optimized netlist uses a Concatenation-based Structure (effectively wiring and a small adder) instead of a large multiplier. For simple cases like this, the optimized output may be represented as a concatenation: assign y = { a, a }; (which implicitly represents the addition and shifting).
